# Personal Computer Recommendation System (PCRS) - Two-Week Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the condensed two-week implementation plan for the Personal Computer Recommendation System (PCRS) frontend. The system helps users get personalized computer recommendations based on their needs, preferences, and budget.

## Project Structure

The project follows a component-based architecture with the following structure:
- `/src`: Main source code
  - `/components`: Reusable UI components
  - `/pages`: Route-based page components
  - `/context`: React context providers
  - `/assets`: Static resources
  - `/hooks`: Custom React hooks
  - `/services`: API service integrations
  - `/utils`: Utility functions
  - `/models`: Data models and types

## Core Features & Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Foundation & User Input

#### Days 1-2: Core UI Setup
1. **Simplified Navigation & Layout**
   - Create a minimal responsive layout
   - Implement basic navigation between main sections
   - Set up theme context and basic styling
   - Priority: HIGH

2. **Homepage & Introduction**
   - Create homepage with clear explanation of service
   - Add "Start Recommendation" prominent call-to-action
   - Implement simple landing page design
   - Priority: HIGH

#### Days 3-5: User Requirements Gathering
3. **Usage Category Selection**
   - Implement core usage categories (Gaming, Work, General Use)
   - Create simple, clear selection cards
   - Store selection in context for later use
   - Priority: CRITICAL

4. **Budget Input**
   - Create simple budget input component
   - Implement basic validation
   - Store budget preference in context
   - Priority: CRITICAL

5. **Basic Questionnaire**
   - Implement simplified multi-step form (3-4 questions max)
   - Focus on key decision factors (performance needs, size constraints, etc.)
   - Store answers in context
   - Priority: CRITICAL

### Week 2: Recommendations & Refinement

#### Days 1-3: Recommendation Engine & Display
6. **Mock Recommendation Service**
   - Create service to generate recommendations based on inputs
   - Implement hardcoded sample recommendations for demo purposes
   - Add recommendation filtering based on user criteria
   - Priority: CRITICAL

7. **Results Display**
   - Create recommendation results page
   - Implement clear, simple recommendation cards
   - Show key specs and price information
   - Priority: CRITICAL

8. **Basic Component Breakdown**
   - Show list of components in each recommendation
   - Implement simple specs display
   - Add basic comparison between 2-3 options
   - Priority: HIGH

#### Days 4-5: Polish & Deployment
9. **User Experience Refinement**
   - Implement basic error handling
   - Add loading states
   - Ensure responsive design works on all devices
   - Priority: HIGH

10. **Deployment & Testing**
    - Fix any critical bugs
    - Deploy to production environment
    - Conduct basic user testing
    - Priority: CRITICAL

## Key Components to Implement

1. **CategorySelector**
   - Simple card-based UI for selecting computer usage type
   - Visual distinction between categories
   - Selection state management

2. **BudgetInput**
   - Simple slider or input field for budget selection
   - Basic validation (min/max values)
   - Clear visual feedback

3. **QuestionnaireForm**
   - 3-4 critical questions about user needs
   - Simple navigation between questions
   - Progress indicator

4. **RecommendationCard**
   - Clean display of recommended computer
   - Key specs highlighted
   - Price prominently displayed
   - Basic "Why this recommendation" explanation

5. **ComponentList**
   - Simple breakdown of components
   - Basic performance indicators
   - Clear specification display

## Context Providers

1. **UserPreferencesContext**
   - Stores all user selections (category, budget, questionnaire answers)
   - Provides methods for updating preferences
   - Persists data in localStorage to prevent loss on refresh

2. **RecommendationContext**
   - Manages recommendation results
   - Provides filtering and sorting capabilities
   - Handles basic comparison functionality

## Simplified API Integration

For this two-week timeline, we'll use a simplified approach:

1. **Recommendation Generation**
   - Create a mock service with predefined recommendation templates
   - Use front-end logic to match user preferences to recommendations
   - Implement filtering based on budget and requirements

2. **Data Management**
   - Store all necessary component data in local JSON files
   - Use localStorage for persistence between sessions
   - Implement simple caching to improve performance

## Testing Approach

1. **Manual Testing**
   - Focus on critical user flows
   - Test on multiple devices/browsers
   - Verify recommendation logic works correctly

2. **User Feedback**
   - Get quick feedback from 2-3 test users
   - Focus on usability issues
   - Prioritize fixing critical user experience problems

## Success Criteria - Minimum Viable Product

For a successful two-week implementation, the system must:

1. Allow users to select their computer usage category
2. Accept budget input
3. Collect basic requirements through a simple questionnaire
4. Display at least 3 computer recommendations that match the criteria
5. Show basic component breakdown for each recommendation
6. Work correctly on both desktop and mobile devices

## Day-by-Day Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation & User Input
- **Day 1:** Set up project structure, implement basic layout and navigation
- **Day 2:** Create homepage, implement theme context and basic styling
- **Day 3:** Build category selection component and interface
- **Day 4:** Implement budget input component and validation
- **Day 5:** Create simplified questionnaire with 3-4 key questions

### Week 2: Recommendations & Refinement
- **Day 1:** Create mock recommendation service and data
- **Day 2:** Implement recommendation filtering based on user inputs
- **Day 3:** Build recommendation display and component breakdown UI
- **Day 4:** Add basic comparison functionality and polish user experience
